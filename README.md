# SearchEngineJokes
Vertical Search Engine of Jokes using Python, PyTerrier, and Flask. Search Engine uses BM25, RM3 query expansion, as well as Learning to Rank approaches.

This project uses jokes from a public Github dataset repository: https://github.com/taivop/joke-dataset

The search engine website is found in the Website folder, and is run locally using the command "python3 main.py"

The file preprocess.py contains the preprocessing done on the original jokes, with the resulting files copied over into the Website folder.
